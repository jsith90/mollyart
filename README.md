# Molly ST | Artist 

This website has been built and designed for a successful artist based in Cardiff, Wales.

The intention is to build a multifaceted site with a portfolio app, shop app, commissions app, a newsletter app and a reviews app, all fully operable from the front end of the site with a superuser log in and custom admin dashboard that allows the site owner to add, update and delete portfolio galleries and shop products (including sizes and quantities), keep track of orders and payments; to be able to write custom newsletters and track (and (de)activate) newsletter subscribers; activate and deactivate reviews.  

Visitors to the site should be able to view artwork via portfolio pages, submit commission proposals to the site owner, purchase shop products, write reviews, sign-up to the site owner's newsletter and learn more about the site owner and her work.

This website will be designed to reflect the aesthetic sensibilities of the site owner: with playful interative pages, which showcase the site owner and her work at all times. The choice of colours shouldn't interfere or take away from the colourful works of the artist but should instead serve and as a compatible backdrop to those works.
